        <p>If you plan to attend a Friday polo match, please note that the early game usually takes place on field 3. This field is not located adjacent to the stadium and therefore there are no amenities, such as seating, provided. Feel free to bring your own food, drink and chairs to enjoy the experience of watching world class polo while tailgating from your car or golf car. Full amenities are available for the matches taking place on Fields 1 and 2 adjacent to the stadium.</p>
