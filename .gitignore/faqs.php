<h3>How/where do I get tickets?</h3>
<p>Tickets can be purchased in advance through The Villages Box Office online (link), at one of their 4 locations, or at the front gate at polo on the day of the event.</p>
<h3>Is my ticket good for the entire day?</h3>
<p>Yes, tickets are good for the entire day.</p>
<h3>What are the best seats?</h3>
<p>The Upper Stadium is the best view of the field but it does require going up a flight of stairs. On the ground level, the reserved tent seats are the best view.</p>
<h3>What is tailgating?</h3>
<p>With a General Admission ticket, guests are able to either sit in our grandstand or park along the far side of the field in our tailgating section. You can tailgate in a car or golf car and you are welcome to bring food, drinks, chairs, tents, and anything else you'd like to make your tailgating experience better.</p>
<h3>Is the polo club open to the public?</h3>
<p>Yes, you don't have to be a member or a Villager to enjoy a polo match. Children are welcome.</p>
<h3>Where can I find the schedule?</h3>
<p>Click here for the schedule.</p>
<h3>What is the recommended attire?</h3>
<p>Polo is an outdoor event so we encourage guests to dress for the weather. We don't require fancy dresses or big hats to enjoy polo. We encourage folks to 'come as they are'.</p>
<h3>Is there a parking fee?</h3>
<p>No, parking is free!</p>
<h3>Is there food and beverage available for purchase?</h3>
<p>Yes, Katie Belles caters all of the matches played at our stadium (fields 1 & 2). They serve a full bar as well as concessions.</p>
<h3>How long does a match last?</h3>
<p>A typical match runs about an hour and a half.
<h3>What if it rains?</h3>
<p>Polo is an outdoor event, but there is shelter under our stadium. We take the horses and the rider's safety into consideration when determining if a match will take place during or after rain. As long as there is no lighting in the area, we can typically play.</p>
<p>If we do have to reschedule a match due to rain, ticket will be honored on the makeup date.</p>
<h3>Are pets allowed?</h3>
<p>Pets are allowed in our tailgate area across the field from the stadium, but not in the stadium. Only service animals are permitted in the stadium.</p>
<h3>Is the stadium wheelchair/stroller accessible?</h3>
<p>Yes, the entire first floor of the stadium is wheelchair and stroller accessible.</p>
<h3>Is there a divot stomp?</h3>
<p>Yes! We have a divot stomp at halftime between the 3rd and 4th chukkers. We encourage guests to come out on the field and help replace the divots. On Sundays, we serve beer, cider or champagne to those of legal age.</p>
<h3>Is there a gift shop?</h3>
<p>Yes! We have a retail store with lots of logoed apparel and souvenirs.</p>
<h3>Can I rent a tent?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! If you wish to tailgate, but donâ€™t want the hassle of setting up your own tent, you can simply rent one from us. Give us a call at (352) 750-7656 and we'll arrange the tent(s), table(s), and chairs for your match of choice.</p>
